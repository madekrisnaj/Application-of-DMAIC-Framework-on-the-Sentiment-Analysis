# Application-of-DMAIC-Framework-on-the-Sentiment-Analysis

This repository contains scraping and sentiment analysis code with the aim of making business recommendations using the DMAIC framework.

## Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is one of the popular tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and belongs to the category of learning that requires targeted learning (Supervised Learning). Sentiment analysis is actually a plain text classification task with a specific goal, namely to find out the sentiment of public opinion on a subject/object (example: HP products at Tokopedia). 

## DMAIC
DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) is a broadly structured problem solving procedure that
used in quality and quality improvement processes. It is often associated
with six sigma activities, and almost all implementations of six sigma
using the DMAIC process

Each step in the cyclical DMAIC Process is required to ensure the best possible results. The process steps:

* **Define** the Customer, their Critical to Quality (CTQ) issues, and the Core Business Process involved.

* **Measure** the performance of the Core Business Process involved.

* **Analyze** the data collected and process map to determine root causes of defects and opportunities for improvement.

* **Improve** the target process by designing creative solutions to fix and prevent problems.

* **Control** the improvements to keep the process on the new course.
